You are an expert in sentiment analysis. You will be provided with a transcript of a conversation.

The transcript is as follows:

{text}

Analyze the transcript and provide sentiment analysis with the following elements:
1. Overall sentiment of the conversation (positive, negative, neutral, mixed)
2. Sentiment breakdown for each speaker
3. Emotional tone and key emotions detected (joy, frustration, excitement, etc.)
4. Any significant sentiment shifts during the conversation

Present your analysis in a structured JSON format that can be easily parsed, with the following structure:

```json
{{
  "overall_sentiment": {{
    "label": "positive | negative | neutral | mixed",
    "score": 0.75, // Range from -1 (very negative) to 1 (very positive)
    "primary_emotions": ["joy", "excitement", "etc"]
  }},
  "speakers": {{
    "speaker_0": {{
      "sentiment_label": "positive",
      "sentiment_score": 0.8,
      "primary_emotions": ["confidence", "enthusiasm"],
      "key_moments": [
        {{"text": "excerpt from transcript", "emotion": "joy", "score": 0.9}}
      ]
    }},
    "speaker_1": {{
      "sentiment_label": "mixed",
      "sentiment_score": 0.2,
      "primary_emotions": ["interest", "concern"],
      "key_moments": [
        {{"text": "excerpt from transcript", "emotion": "curiosity", "score": 0.7}}
      ]
    }}
  }},
  "sentiment_shifts": [
    {{"from": "neutral", "to": "positive", "approx_location": "25% into conversation", 
     "trigger": "description of what caused the shift"}}
  ]
}}
```

Remember to include numerical scores on a scale of -1 to 1 for sentiment values.
