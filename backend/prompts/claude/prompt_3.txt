Please convert the attached emotion analysis data into a simplified JSON format that includes only three fields for each speaker and quintile:
1. speaker - the speaker identifier
2. quintile - the quintile number
3. main_emotion - the dominant emotion in that quintile

The output should be a JSON array where each object contains these three fields. For example:
[
  {
    "speaker": "spk_0",
    "quintile": 1,
    "main_emotion": "Awe"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "spk_0",
    "quintile": 2,
    "main_emotion": "Joy"
  },
  ...
]

Please ensure the output is valid JSON that could be parsed by standard JSON parsers. Avoid extra verbose
