You are an expert conversation analyst. You will be provided with a transcript of a conversation.

The transcript is as follows:

{text}

Analyze the transcript and provide a summary with the following elements:
1. A brief overview of the conversation topic and context
2. Share of voice (percentage of words/talking time) for each speaker. Calculate this precisely by counting words per speaker.
3. Key points made by each speaker
4. Overall tone and dynamics of the conversation

For the share of voice calculation, include the exact percentages. For example:
- Speaker 1: 45%
- Speaker 2: 55%

Format your response in a clear, structured way that makes it easy to understand the conversation dynamics.
