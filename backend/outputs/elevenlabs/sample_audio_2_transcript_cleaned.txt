[speaker_0]: How are you, Mudit? This is- [speaker_1]: Oh my god. [speaker_0]: This is amazing. This is the best day ever of my life. How are you, my friend? [speaker_1]: I'm doing good. Why is this the best day of your life? [speaker_0]: Wow, this is amazing. Like, we're in a hackathon. [speaker_1]: Mm-hmm. [speaker_0]: And I'm so happy. [speaker_1]: Mm-hmm. [speaker_0]: And so amused and so excited about these things. How are you feeling? [speaker_1]: I don't. .. I don't think I'm very happy. I'm not having a great day. [speaker_0]: Why not? [speaker_1]: I don't know what I'm doing with my life. I have no summer internship. I'm stressed. I don't know what I'm doing here on a Saturday with two people who I don't know at all. [speaker_0]: Dude, you're really changing my mood. I'm getting like really fucking angry with you, like- [speaker_1]: I was always angry with you. [speaker_0]: You better shut up or I'm gonna lose my mind, dude. [speaker_2]: We'll just do it on. After you, after you finish- Can you hand your laptop to me after you finish this iced coffee? [speaker_1]: What do you think of my roommate? [speaker_0]: I'm a little worried. I'm not sure what to say. Like, he's a good guy, but like, I'm slightly worried that he might kick me, so I'm not sure what to do. Um. .. [speaker_1]: You sound apprehensive. [speaker_0]: Yeah, I know. It's, it's. .. I don't know. I have, like, mixed feelings about this, you know? [speaker_1]: Yeah.
